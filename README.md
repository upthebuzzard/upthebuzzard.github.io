## History

This project was initially an experiment to port a small Wordpress.com site to Jekyll.

Despite developing on Windows and getting that sinking feeling about the json-related gems etc, it has gone well.

The following things are, basically, lovely:

* Jekyll
* GitHub Pages
* Markdown
* Git

Notes and learnings about using Jekyll are captured in http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/jekyll_notes/.

With the GitHub Pages restriction forbidding the use of bespoke Ruby code, it removes the temptation for diverging from vanilla Jekyll and heading off into the regret-filled cul-de-sac of Doing It My Way.

## TODO

* find a simple way of enabling https (currently not supported for custom domains on GitHib Pages).
* some kind of search facility
* and some other things...
