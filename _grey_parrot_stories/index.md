The Grey Parrot stories [emerged along with](/moose_and_goose_stories/a-brief-history-of-moose-and-goose) the [Moose &amp; Goose stories](/moose_and_goose_stories), but it was clear they were a different kettle of fish.

_Animals with big questions go to the grey parrot for answers,  
and they do get answers,  
but soon wish they had never asked ..._  

These are short stories for kids, to be read aloud by a grown up at bedtime. They all follow the same theme. There are no pictures. Imaginations are essential. Participation is encouraged.
