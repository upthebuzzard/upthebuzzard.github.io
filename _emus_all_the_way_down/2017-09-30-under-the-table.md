* Eli first meets Rachel
* Eli is under the kitchen table at a party
* not bored, but at a loss, mid-life bewilderment, albeit mid 20s
* its a big table, but is not comfortable, but is clean and dry
* party ebbs and flows, but is a big house so does not focus on the kitchen
* some chairs, some crates of beer and cider
* he has a can of cider, opened, but just sipping very slowly
* not drunk, or even got a buzz
* friends are getting very drunk and rowdy, mostly not unpleasant
* sense might have to go and do some damage limitation
* music is not loud in the kitchen, much louder in lounge
* not sure why he ended up under the table, just sort of happened
* is part of the reason why he is bewildered, not drunk, but has ended up under the table
* someone drags a chair across, and sits at the table, kicks/nudges him in the back in the process, he apologises and moves over, no reaction, person stays in chair, doesn't look
* time passes, getting quite hard to sip from the can since can't tip head back and can is part empty now, back is sore, bum is very numb, so decided to crawl out into the party and apologise on behalf of the group of (now very drunk) people he came in with
* realises the person there has been tapping away on a laptop, all that time, quite vigorously, but he hadn't heard it under the table
* which made no sense, since it should have been conducted through the table, even if the air-bound noise was drowned out by the music blaring in from the lounge.
* enough cider consumed to brave the question, "can I see under your laptop?".
* breaks concentration of young woman, "where did you come from?",
   * answer: "under the table where you kicked me a while ago".
   * "Ah, I thought that was a pile of bags and coats. Any injuries?".
   * "Not from that, but plenty from sitting under the table for too long."
   * "Too long? Is there a just long enough?".
   * "Depends, I'm thinking, now, for the first time about the topic, on if there was a purpose to being under the table."
   * "Ah, that makes sense. And your purpose was?"
   * "Um, that I now realise I lack a purpose. I have reached a mid-life bewilderment."
   * "OK. Realising this was your purpose?"
   * "Um, I didn't start with it as my purpose, but it is what happened. I just suddenly pictured it, the purposelessness, and there it was, a thing."
   * "Has it helped, sitting under the table?"
   * "Um, my self-awareness has presumably gone up a notch, although I'm not really happy about what it is I am now aware of, but I can all info is good info if you can make use it."
   * "Um, can I just say this is the longest conversation I have had with a female in like. Well, ever. Thank you. I guess I should also thank the half can of cider, and the fact that I had not drunk any more of it. So, can I?"
   * "Can you what?"
   * "Look under your laptop?"
   * "Oh yes. Ok. Here you go. Why?"
   * "Big rubber feet. Not seen such big ones before, on a laptop."
   * "My brother told me it was ruggerised."
   * "You mean ruggedised."
   * "Do I? Ok. Maybe I do. So, half cider under the table boy, why does that matter to you?"
   * "Sorry, it's just a habit, and yes I know it's an annoying habit, probably a form of Tourettes. I seem unable to resist blurting out the correct spelling of words when someone get's it wrong."
   * "Ok, yes, that is an annoying habit, but that was not what I meant. Why did you want to see under my laptop in the first place?"
   * "Um, because you were typing pretty heavily and I didn't hear you."
   * "So..."
   * "I should have heard you, through the table."
   * "And you know this how?"
   * "Well, I should have. The conduction of your banging the keyboard should have been plenty loud enough for me to hear. To feel in fact, since my head was pretty much against the underside of the table, but I did not pick up any vibes."
   * "And so the first thing you needed to say to someone whose legs you've been ogling for a good hour, was you type too heavily and what's that underneath your laptop?"
   * "Um. Well, I didn't look at your legs. I'll go. Sorry."
   * "Stay, under the table half a can of cider eyes shut but ears open boy. I am not having a go. I think I have never met someone so polite and awkward at the same time."
   *
