One significant point in the hifi-on-the-cheap journey was discovering the difference a good DAC can make, and that I don't like listening to music on headphones. Podcasts are a different matter, though. Very happy to listen to hours of those, often on the train. Even then, decent hifi gear makes a difference, but is less impactful than with music.

From my own brief dabblings with headphones, I can make the following observations:

* Bluetooth provides a kind of quality threshold. 

If you have a trained ear, a good DAC, a high rez signal source, and good headphones, then you can probably (I believe) hear the difference between bluetooth and wired headphones. In that case, you might want to head on down this particular rabbit hole, seeking the perfect sound. Small improvements are more apparent with headphones. 

You have my sympathies.

* If this is your first time seeing the term DAC, it is a Digital-to-Analogue converter. Any system that takes digitised music and plays audible music must have a DAC somewhere along the signal path. All modern laptops and phone have them as a matter of course.

* With headphones, in-ear, on-ear, over-ear, open/closed back, etc, is a purely personal preference. 

Open-back ones let external noise in and your music out, so are only really sensible (or polite) in the privacy of your own home. 

Some headphones are notoriously hard to 'drive', and you need to pay attention to the power rating of the headphone amplifier output. 

* for reasonably good headphones, a decent dongle DAC can make an audible difference. 

Although technological marvels, laptops and, to a greater extent, smartphones have to compromise on every system they incorporate. For DACs, they have not got the space (or the price) for much beyond the basic functionality.

For only a little bit of money, you can get a 'dongle DAC'. This device plugs into the laptop or smartphone and has a socket for wired headphones. I have a Dragonfly Black dongle DAC, the cheapest of the Dragonfly series, and available for very little second hand. Since I only ever listen to audio using a digital source (laptop or smartphone), I leave my dongle more or less permanently attached to my headphones. One bit of technical jargon worth knowing is the extra cable it needs to connect from the USB B end of the dongle to the USB C socket in most devices nowadays is an 'On-The-Go' (or OTG) connector. Not just any old USB B to C adapter will do.

The other Dragonflies are (apparently) noticeably better if you have good headphones. And, since they kind of set the scene, assorted competitors have entered the market. But with my particular headphones, the Black one is good enough for me.

* There are a few different socket sizes, most common being 3.5mm, but also bigger and smaller. Worth checking if you need an adapter.

* The trend for new smartphones to no longer have standard headphone sockets has been annoying. 

If you don't want to switch to bluetooth (and new headphones), you can use a dongle DAC as the adapter, since all (most?) smartphones will have a USB socket, so not really a big issue.

* the 'system' you are seeking to optimise in this hifi nice is
   * headphones
   * in-phone or dongle DAC
   * music source (to a lesser extent)

The synergy between DAC and headphones can be quite marked. Some have it. Some don't.

As you get better headphones, you will (probably) hear the inadequacies in your DAC, and to a lesser extent your music source. 

As you get a better DAC, other (more expensive) headphones might suddenly sound noticeably better. 

Again, you have my sympathies.
