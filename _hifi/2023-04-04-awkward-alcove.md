    And with those new speakers, hifi nirvana. Suddenly all the other parts of the system can shine too.

The awkward alcove is as follows:

* It's an alcove.
* It's awkward.
* All the hifi components sit on an old wooden dresser base, including the speakers. 
* Enough width on top to allow the speakers to sit either side of the stack.
* There are big shelves above, just high enough to allow the lid of the record player to open fully.
* No good, seated listening position.
* No convenient spot for a subwoofer.

Finding a setup that worked here was a mostly frustrating process, which suddenly became enjoyable with the last step when it all became worthwhile. It can be summarised as

* New speakers, yay
* Hm, placement? Ok in near-field, but ...
* More placement, nope
* [Port bungs](#port-bungs)! Better, but ...
* The muffled, muddy sound is so annoying, I don't want to listen to this.
* Maybe better cables? Nope. I knew it wouldn't help.
* More placement, nope.
* Chromecast. Nice, but ...
* Speaker pads. Record player is defo happier, but ...
* Its the speakers! Has to be. Perhaps front-ported is necessary?
* New, [front ported speakers](#frontrear-ported-and-sealed) ... Aaaah !!!

And with those new speakers, hifi nirvana. Suddenly all the other parts of the system can shine too. A really nice moment. 

Obviously bought the previous speakers a bit early, before the full horrors of the awkward alcove became apparent. Those speakers sound great in other situations. They are nice, but not in the awkward alcove.

For the record, I have ended up with the following system. It sounds lovely to my ears, and is easily upgradeable should the need or urge arise. 

* Speakers: Elac Debut B5.2
   * biggish small speakers, front-ported, rave reviews. On the upper edge of what I was willing to pay. I can attest that these sound fabulous. The reviews were mostly with them on speaker stands, so they will presumably sound even better in that situation. But in a cramped alcove, still lovely. (£195)
      * Alternative front-ported speakers that might have been worth trying, and available quite a bit cheaper secondhand, are the Wharfedale Diamond 9.1, which reviewed well (but not as well as the Elacs). Couldn't find many other alternative front-ported speakers that were not appreciably more expensive.
* Speaker [isolation](#isolating_components) pads
   * These are cheap foam pads to sit the speakers on, to prevent the vibrations from the speakers conducting through the table top and into the record player, in particular. Also lets you angle the speakers up a bit. Works very nicely. (£15)
      * Lots of options here. Plenty of opinions. 
* Amplifier: Rega Brio 3
   * A wanna-be audiophile amp from the mid 2000s, great reviews, bought secondhand. Minimal, no tone controls, just an input selector and volume knobs. Sounds very nice. Has a nice phono stage, so ready for a record player. Has a Tape Out for that cassette recorder no-one has any more. Plenty of power. (~£150)
      * I suspect there are many other amplifiers that would be as good here. It is now a space/convenience thing. No room for the amp to be taller. The super small class D amps (like the [Aiyima D03](2023-04-04-desktop-audio)) might be worth a try. But I like the way this one sounds. If the later, better, smaller Rega amps drop in price a bit more secondhand, might pounce on one of those, since they could squeeze into the space alongside the record player.
* Record Player: Rega Planar 1
   * A cheap-but-good record player from the early 90s. Very simple, minimal. Still works well. Record players are quite cheap these days, but records are not. Its not clear if there is a future for this beast. CDs and now streaming are so much more convenient and high (higher) quality, it is questionable if the extra faff and ritual of putting on a record is worthwhile.
* DAC: Loxjie D30
   * A nice, compact unit, great reviews, bought second hand. Handles all the usual suspects: COAX, optical, bluetooth. Also has a headphone socket, [but I don't use that](2023-04-03-headphones-on-the-move). (~£130)
      * Every day there seems to be another good-but-cheap DAC on the market. Lots of options. 
* [Digital streamer](#streaming): Wiim Pro Streamer
   * A nice compact unit, Sounds great, possibly better than my previous [Google Chromecast Audio](#google-chromecast-audio). Has additional connectivity for an optical and analog inputs, so can daisy chain a new source into this. It has a smartphone app. (~£150)
      * Probably overqualified for my needs, since I only wanted to handle Chromecast for now, but still cheap for all that.
* CD Player: Arcam Alpha
   * An old CD player from the early 90s. Has most definitely been surpassed by newer, cheaper models. With CDs themselves now being supplanted by streaming and, yes, a resurgence of vinyl, not sure what the future is for this component. Sound quality improved noticeably when I switched to using it as just a [CD transport](#cd-transport), outputting via COAX to the DAC.
      * Is proving hard to find a smaller, better, cheap CD transport. Possibly the Tangent CD II, which (apparently) sounds good, but it has a challenging UX (no display), and does not [play gaplessly](#gapless-playback) (which annoys many).
* Speaker cables: QED XT25
   * Went with one step up from bargain basement. Found some reviews which indicated they were good. Sounds good to me. They feel solid. Lots of other options. (~£7/m)
* Other Cables: mostly Amazon Basics
   * Assorted reviews indicate these are fine for most 'normal' systems. Sounds ok to me, and feels solid enough, good quality. Lots of other options.

It became painfully clear that the speakers booming in the alcove were the limiting factor. Until that was resolved, nothing else was going to help much. With suitable speakers, all the other component can do their thing, unimpeded. 

Favourite track of the moment: Cowboy Junkies' Witches. A quiet song, played loud. Simple guitar, then the voice starts. 'Hairs on the back of the neck' time. So rich, warm, personal. You can feel the existential power of the moment, with supernatural overtones.
