To answer the in-title question first: yes, it is. This is the defining characteristic of desktop audio. In essence, the speakers are so close to the listener, and the volume so low, that any colouration from the room is minimised to the point where it makes no significant difference to what you hear. In practical terms, this is when your ears are closer to each speaker than the speakers are apart, i.e. most desktop situations.

By comparison, far-field listening, when you are further away from the speakers, is when you _do_ hear colouration from the room, such as reverb, echos, boom-y bass, dead spots, etc. In most realistic situations, in far-field listening the negative effects of the room can easily become the main limiting factor when trying to improve your sound.

You can think of headphones as being at the nearest of near end of the near-field experience. 

When you see a picture of an audio mixing desk tooled up with multiple pairs of speakers, some of those speakers are for near-field listening, often referred to as [studio monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_monitor), and some are for far-field listening. Both types are catered for because the same recording sounds different in the different 'fields'.

There are 3 main ways to go with desktop audio, assuming you have a computer and/or wifi providing the music source:

1. headphones, [which are not my preference](2023-04-03-headphones-on-the-move)
2. powered speakers, where the amplifier is baked into the speakers
3. passive speakers, where you have a separate amplifier driving the speakers

Assuming you go the passive speakers route, there are various options
* combined amplifier and DAC
* separate amplifier, DAC

And the addition of
* a sub-woofer
* source

We can address these combinations holistically. 

Firstly, on a desktop, your speakers will most likely be small, and that means very little bass. They can sound nice and clear, and can be an listening pleasure as is. But, with the best will in the world, there will be little bass oomph. Cranking up the bass tone control (assuming you have one) will be an exercise in futility.  

My first concrete suggestion is to assume you will benefit from a powered (aka active) [subwoofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subwoofer). This is a speaker built for bass, and will supply your missing oomph. Many powered speakers cater for subwoofers, as do many amplifiers.

As for whether you go with powered vs active speakers, separate vs combined components, the main considerations are
* Space. Active speakers, and/or combined components, mean fewer things to have to place somewhere. Even 'small' speakers can be feel quite big on a cramped desk. 
* Wiring/clutter. Passive speakers need more wiring, as do separate components.
* Upgradability. If you go the all-in-1 route, most upgrades are likely to involve changing the whole thing. Keeping things separate means you can change one (smaller) piece at a time.
* Sources. Are you just going to connect by bluetooth, or do you want to use a network streamer via an optical connection, for example?

For the record, I have ended up with the following system. It sounds lovely to my ears, and is easily upgradeable should the need or urge arise. 

* Speakers: JBL Control ONE. 
   * Small, cheap (especially secondhand), with a mounting point on the back to anchor them to the wall. NB, the supplied wall mounts are rubbish, but it is easy get a solid wall-mounted clamp that can grab onto the 'lollipop' at the back. In near-field, and in combination with a subwoofer, these are fabulous. Not so great in a bigger room, but so what.
* Subwoofer: Cambridge Audio Minx X200 Active 200W.
   * Small, cheap (secondhand), sounds great. Very easy to place and use. In a small room, under the desk, can rattle the china on a shelf in the next room.
* DAC+Amplifier: Aiyima D03.
   * Small, cheap (secondhand), powerful, sounds great. Has a 'sub out' socket, and tone controls. Can take optical, COAX, bluetooth, etc inputs. If I ever want to get a better DAC, I can simply add that as the input to the D03, just using the amplifier part. If I do upgrade the DAC, I can then upgrade the amplifier separately. But for now, the D03 ticks all the audio boxes.
* Digital streaming source: [Google Chromcast Audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast#Chromecast_Audio).
   * Very small, cheap, high quality. This is a marvelous device that lets you 'cast' audio over wifi to your system without needing to keep your smartphone or laptop in the loop, passing the signal along. Is only available secondhand, since Google discontinued the device, but is plentiful on ebay (albeit the price has gone _up_). The 'chromecast' standard is still actively maintain by Google, and plenty of devices support it. Higher quality than bluetooth. 

Related notes and terms

* There are various ways of hooking up any amplifier and speakers to sub-woofers, but it makes your life much easier if your amplifier (or powered speakers) has a socket labelled '**sub out**', or sometimes 'line out', or equivalent. This socket is specifically for connecting a powered sub-woofer. You can easily get the appropriate cable for this. Almost all powered subwoofers can take this as input.
* Look for assorted advice videos on how to connect a sub-woofer in other ways. You can go via the speaker cables, for example, depending on your subwoofer.
* There is a big caveat around a very similar-looking socket on the amplifier, sometimes called a '**aux out**'. It is probably _not_ what you need. This sends through a fixed signal volume signal, rather than adjusting the signal output in sync with the volume knob on the amplifier.
* The big caveat to the big caveat is when you have a **pre-amplifier** feeding your amplifier, or something functioning as a pre-amplifier. The basic gist here is that many components have their own volume controls on the signals they pass to amplifiers. In that case, the amplifier can be set to play whatever it gets at a fixed (loud) volume, and you control the input volume on your pre-amplifier, or headphone amplifier, or streaming device, etc. In this situation, you _can_ use the 'aux out' socket to feed a sub-woofer, because the signal being sent to the amplifier itself will be varying in volume, so the 'aux out' will be in sync with the signal going to the speakers.
* The bass sound is more or less **omni-directional**, so you can stick your subwoofer out of the way (under the desk) and still benefit from it.
* Dialling in the subwoofer, or positioning it and then choosing the right dial settings, is an enjoyable process. There are lots of self-help videos for this process. The main things to worry about are (a) getting the phase right, so your subwoofer and speakers are toing and froing in sync, and (b) crank up the gain on the subwoofer til your feel the thump thump of the bass, then dial it back down slowly until you can't quite hear the thump any more. From here it is a matter of taste, but you will be in the ball park. In a bigger room, in far-field mode, you have more things to worry about regarding placement. But for a desktop, this will be fine.
* My experiences of a nicely **dialled-in** subwoofer under the desk is that (a) you can't hear the subwoofer as its own thing (if you can, it is not dialled in well), and (b) your tiny desktop speakers now sound much bigger (actually taller), with a rich deep, resonant sound. I think it is fair to say that good small speakers plus subwoofer can easily sound better than the best small speakers.
* Audiophiles rave about having two, separate, stereo subwoofers. It seems to be a spiritual experience for those who have tried it. However, you need the space, the money, the amplifier, etc, to benefit from it. 
* **High pass filter**. This is when the input signal is filtered so that only the 'high' frequencies pass through, presumably for a speaker which can specifically handle high frequencies, e.g. not the subwoofer.
* **Low pass filter**. This is when the input signal is filtered so that only the low frequencies pass through, i.e. not for a small speaker. Is often available via a dial on the back of subwoofers, and lets the subwoofer know below which frequency it should start pumping out the sound. It depends on how low the main speakers can go. With small speakers (like above), the low pass filter would be set quite high.
* **Crossover**. This is an element inside most speakers which have two or more different speaker drive units, usually a woofer (the bigger one, for mids and bass, gets the low pass filter), and a tweeter (the smaller one, for treble, gets the high pass filter).
* front/back ported (and sealed). Speakers move air around. A ported speaker moves air with the front speaker drivers, and lets air in and out in sync via the ports. The air coming in and out of these ports can itself contribute to the sound of the speakers. 
   * **Back-ported** speakers push this air (and sound) out of the back, where it can interact with the wall and combine with the front-directed sound when in far-field listening mode. If the speakers are cramped, in a small enclosed space, playing loud, this can sound very boom-y, and not nice at all. If you simply have to live with this (as I have, for a while), I can recommend 'port bungs', which are foam rubber inserts in the port hole to restrict the 'huffing' and booming. They work well enough to be worth trying.
   * **Front-ported** speakers have the port at the front, and are generally less affected by being jammed in an alcove, tight up against a wall. 
   * **Sealed** speakers are just that, sealed. Often designed to be attached to or even embedded in a wall.
   * Arguments rage around which are better. At low volumes, near-field, on a desktop, almost a non-issue. In a bigger room, far-field, if the speakers are in a cramped location, my experience is that front-ported is better.
* **Tone controls**. To have or not to have, used to be a major point of contention. In old school hifi, the tone controls in cheap systems were often clumsy and harmed sound quality, hence were all considered bad. These days, it is possible to have effective, not bad tone controls. So, ok. It does let you fine tune your system, and achieve a more harmonious balance. Modern, cheap amps and DACs, while producing high quality sound, might have a tendency to be a bit sibiliant, If both amp and DAC by default have this tendency, it can sound quite harsh. A simple tweak of the treble tone control however and that problem goes away.
* **JBL Control ONE**, are ubiquitous in the world of theatre and the like. They are one of the go-to ways for the sound engineers and stage hands to ensure some noise happens somewhere on stage. Consequently, there are loads of cheap, beaten up secondhand ones available on ebay. They can also be very old, since the same basic design has been going for years. Be careful to check the state of the foam surround on the main speakers, which rots after a decade or two.
