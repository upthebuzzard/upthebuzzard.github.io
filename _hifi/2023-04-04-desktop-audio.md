To answer the in-title question first: yes, it is. Near-field listening is the defining characteristic of desktop audio. In essence, the speakers are so close to the listener, and the volume so low, that any colouration from the room is minimised to the point where it makes no significant difference to what you hear. In practical terms, this is when your ears are closer to each speaker than the speakers are apart, or to any source of interference, i.e. most desktop situations.

By comparison, far-field listening, when you are further away from the speakers, is when you _do_ hear colouration from the room, such as reverb, echos, boom-y bass, dead spots, etc. In most realistic situations, in far-field listening the negative effects of the room can easily become the main limiting factor when trying to improve your sound.

You can think of headphones as being at the nearest of near ends of the near-field experience. 

When you see a picture of an audio mixing desk tooled up with multiple pairs of speakers, some of those speakers are for near-field listening, often referred to as [studio monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_monitor), and some are for far-field listening. Both types are catered for because the same recording sounds different in the different 'fields'.

There are 3 main ways to go with desktop hifi, assuming you have a computer and/or wifi providing the music source:

1. headphones, [which are not my preference](2023-04-03-headphones-on-the-move)
2. powered speakers, where the amplifier is baked into the speakers
3. passive speakers, where you have a separate amplifier driving the speakers

Assuming you go the passive speakers route, there are various options
* combined amplifier and [DAC](#dac)
* separate amplifier, DAC

And the addition of
* a subwoofer
* source

We can address these combinations holistically. 

Firstly, on a desktop, your speakers will most likely be small, and that means very little bass. They can sound nice and clear, and can be an listening pleasure as is. But, with the best will in the world, there will be little bass oomph. Cranking up the bass [tone control](#tone-controls) (assuming you have one) will be an exercise in futility.  

My first concrete suggestion is to assume you will benefit from a powered (aka active) subwoofer. This is a speaker built for bass, and will supply your missing oomph. Many powered speakers cater for subwoofers, as do many amplifiers.

As for whether you go with powered vs active speakers, separate vs combined components, the main considerations are
* Space. Active speakers, and/or combined components, mean fewer things to have to place somewhere. Even 'small' speakers can be feel quite big on a cramped desk. 
* Wiring/clutter. Passive speakers need more wiring, as do separate components.
* Upgradability. If you go the all-in-1 route, most upgrades are likely to involve changing the whole thing. Keeping things separate means you can change one (smaller) piece at a time. Tweaking your system might in fact be the hobby.
* Sources. Are you just going to connect by bluetooth, or do you want to use a network streamer via an optical connection, for example?

For the record, I have ended up with the following system. It sounds lovely to my ears, and is easily upgradeable should the need or urge arise. 

* Speakers: [JBL Control ONE](#jbl-control-one). 
   * Small, cheap (especially secondhand), with a mounting point on the back to anchor them to the wall. NB, the supplied wall mounts are rubbish, but it is easy get a solid wall-mounted clamp that can grab onto the 'lollipop' part of the official mount at the back. In near-field, and in combination with a subwoofer, these are fabulous. Not so great in a bigger room, but so what. There are reports that the 'Professional' variant is better, but I suspect I'd have difficulty in hearing a difference. (£30)
* [Subwoofer](#subwoofer): Cambridge Audio Minx X200 Active 200W.
   * Small, cheap (secondhand), sounds great. Very easy [to place and use](#dialling-in-the-subwoofer). In a small room, under the desk, can rattle the china on a shelf in the next room. [Easy to connect](#connecting-a-subwoofer). (~£130)
* DAC+Amplifier: Aiyima D03.
   * Small, cheap (secondhand), powerful, sounds great. Has a [sub out](#connecting-a-subwoofer) socket, and [tone controls](#tone-controls). Can take optical, COAX, bluetooth, etc inputs. If I ever want to get a better DAC, I can simply add that as the input to the D03, just using the amplifier part. If I do upgrade the DAC, I can then upgrade the amplifier separately. But for now, the D03 ticks all my desktop hifi boxes. (~£80)
* Digital streaming source: [Google Chromecast Audio](#google-chromecast-audio).
   * Very small, cheap (yes, secondhand), high quality, marvelous. (~£55)
* Speaker Cable: QED XT25
   * Saw these in a review. Pleasingly firm. Works for me. Not a bargain basement cable, but not expensive either. (~£7/m)
* Other Cables: mostly Amazon Basics
   * assorted reviews indicate these are fine for most 'normal' systems. Sounds ok to me, and feels solid enough, good quality. Lots of other options.

This system is a pleasure to use. Sounds great. On low volumes, everything is very clear and deep. The laptop speakers sound tinny by comparison. On high volumes, still sounds great, albeit no more working is possible.

Can be left musicing along as the Chromecast device steps through a long playlist. 

The D03 sits on a little ledge _under_ the desk, but within reach. All the cabling disappears behind the desk. 

The speakers are mounted 6in above the desk, attached to a wooden plank which in turn is attached to the wall. (A word to the wise - it is far easier to attach a wide wooden plank to the wall, and _then_ experiment with speaker placement.)
