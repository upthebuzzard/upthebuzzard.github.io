My dabblings in the area of hifi began with a bang as a uni student when I wandered wide-eyed and naive into a hifi store. The most money I had ever had in-hand, I listened to some nice gear. With no adult supervision, I fell for the [#1 trick in the hifi store book](#1-trick-in-the-hifi-store-book) (listened to a slightly better item, "Only costs a bit more, but you can hear the difference"). I left with some nice hifi, admittedly, but paid way over the odds for what I needed then or was able to appreciate. 

To be slightly fair to my (much younger) self:
* There wasn't much in the way of cheap-but-actually-good hifi around then. Cheap was mostly synonymous with 'not good'.
* Living in small uni rooms, I was often in near-field listening mode, which I was not aware of at the time.
* Also, no internet !!!

Several ignorant, more or less random hifi purchases, and decades, later, lockdown meant much working from home. The laptop speakers were a bit rubbish, so I put some actual thought and research into what I needed to have some nice music at my desk. This thought and research was the most fun I had had, hifi-wise. So much out there. So many systems and options. So much jargon. So many videos. So much to spend much money on. And, interestingly, so much to spend little money on. 

'Good hifi on the cheap' became the more nuanced hifi hobby. Yes, I could watch or read a review of a high (but nowhere near highest)-end, Â£2000 amplifier, nodding wisely at all the stated benefits, but I was cherishing more the finding of reviews like "This is the best, cheapest thingy I have ever heard. Why is no-one else reviewing it?". Around this time there was a sharp upsurge in cheap, really good amplifiers and [DAC](#dac)s out of China. There was a hifi arms race under way. A race to the top. Hifi reviewers were grudgingly conceding that some of these super cheap components were actually not bad. A good time to be interested in hifi.

Along the way I have picked up an understanding of various useful hifi terms and considerations, and an understanding of how to assess the overall hifi system, and where it is worth spending a bit more (but not too much) money. High end hifi is an exercise in extravagantly expensive, diminishing returns. There is a much earlier, cheaper stage where a little bit more money and/or care reaps a big, audibly noticeable reward. _And_ there is a companion stage where the system works together well, sounds great, and spending more on any part of it is not likely to result in a significant gain in sound quality.

I _think_ I have reached the stage with two separate hifi systems, in two very different parts of the house (from an audio POV), where it is more or less as good as it gets for the small sums of money involved, and diminishing returns is the most likely way forward. Which is great. The hifi(s) sound really nice. Much better than what I used to accept as 'hifi', considerably cheaper, with lots of options should I get afflicted with [GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome)](#gas-gear-acquisition-syndrome).
