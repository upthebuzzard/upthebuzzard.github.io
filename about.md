Hi,

what you see in these pages is a much belated consequence of a very enjoyable year of bedtime stories improvised by one dad and two sons, aged 4 and 7.

The stories may not make sense to anyone outside my family, but I've set some of the less convoluted ones down here as a resource for anyone who would like to try them out on their own children.

The stories fall into a couple of themes:

* [The Moose &amp; Goose Stories](/moose_and_goose_stories/), for ages 4-11, ish. Problem solving.
* [The Gray Parrot Stories](/grey_parrot_stories/), for younger ones, say, 3-6, ish. Convoluted solutions.

Assorted writing followed, including some made up nonsense arising from a delayed train commute home, and most recently, some games.

I've gone with the [Creative Commons copyright](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) which basically means you are free to copy, mangle, and share these stories as you see fit, as long as:
* you attribute me (by citing [stories.upthebuzzard.com](http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/));
* you don't make money from them;
* and you continue with the same copyright if you distribute what you've made of them.

It most especially does mean that you are <strong>free to read out the kids' ones to your kids and mess about vigorously with the details and get them involved</strong>, which was kind of the original point of publishing them.

To the best of my knowledge all images used on this site are (or were) free for non-commercial re-use, and have been attributed in the post where they appear. [@Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has been a good source. Any non-attributed images are my own, and presumably the CC conditions (above) apply.

If you have any feedback on how the stories pan out under battle conditions, do please let me know.
