# Notes

scenarios
* person is repeatedly awoken and asked for choice to be fully awoken or returned to stasis
   * done brusquely
   * increasingly confusing language
      * language changes, new terminology
   * too quick to understand
   * had chosen cheap stasis option
      * woken every 50 years
         * only partially
      * max 5 mins per consultation (since animating is expensive)
   * always awakes in confusion, nausea, vertigo
   * then awakenings become very smooth/slick/instantaneous
      * takes several awakenings before realises not physical
      * elapsed time is then measured relative to speed of mental functioning
         * years become minutes
   * questions asked
      * voices
         * Artificial
         * human
            * bored

         * charity takes over
      * what is your name?
         * confusion, since is first question received
         * used to
            * indicate mental competence of patient
            * id
         * mandatory
            * no progress until answered
      * you have 3 options
         * return to stasis
         * awake fully
            * not offered initially
         * euthanasia
      * do you have any further questions in your allotted 5 mins?
         * time does not roll over to next period
   * elapsed time
      * 50 years
      * then 50 minutes
      * then 5 minutes
   * memories
      * why enter stasis?
         * current political situation boring/annoying
         * mentally fit
         * government offered tax breaks for working with longevity institutes
            * by entering stasis, forgoes rights to state pension, covered by long-term investments
         * no family, boring dead-end job, no prospects, not poor, will never be rich
      * recalls some of previous awakenings,
         * only early answers in session, not later answers
   * voices
      * background chatter
      * silence, person asking questions, no answers
      * click then quick apology
         * "this is the supervisor, just noticed you were speaking after opting for stasis. The system decouples from your brain and starts putting you into stasis. The process has begun. I see you have asked lots of questions. No time to answer them. You'll be out in a few seconds. Sorry I can't help. Perhaps mentally prepare a couple of questions now for when you next wake up, I *think* that might work for you. Good luck."
   * changes
      * human voice, bored, accent odd
         * impatient
      * human voice, remote, accent very odd
         * computer voice giving countdown
      * smooth, clear voice, good accent, no hurry
      * hospital room
          * becomes clear is VR
          * consequence of breakdown/poor design in stasis machine,
             * each awakening causes increased loss of short term memory
                * no coherent memory of why entered stasis
             * mind and memories uploaded into virtual storage
                * incoherent memories available for browsing, with caveats
                * recordings of awakenings' conversations
             * criteria for awakening no longer relevant
             * online, passage of time is consensual, relative to speed of thought
                * much faster than real time, hence time passes slowly in real world
