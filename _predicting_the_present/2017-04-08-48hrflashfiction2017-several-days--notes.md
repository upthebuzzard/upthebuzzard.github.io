         * awake fully
            * not offered initially
         * euthanasia
      * do you have any further questions in your allotted 5 mins?
         * time does not roll over to next period

      * 50 years
      * then 50 minutes
      * then 5 minutes

         * no family, boring dead-end job, no prospects, not poor, will never be rich
      * recalls some of previous awakenings,
         * only early answers in session, not later answers
   * voices
      * background chatter
      * silence, person asking questions, no answers
      * click then quick apology
         * "this is the supervisor, just noticed you were speaking after opting for stasis. The system decouples from your brain and starts putting you into stasis. The process has begun. I see you have asked lots of questions. No time to answer them. You'll be out in a few seconds. Sorry I can't help. Perhaps mentally prepare a couple of questions now for when you next wake up, I *think* that might work for you. Good luck."
