<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am not unfeeling, of the effect my needs have on those I need. I do what I must to survive, and yet it haunts me. I now sow a new flower for each of those I take. While I sleep, my people maintain those that I have planted, else my gesture would be hollow. I am not unfeeling.</p>&mdash; Chris Gathercole (@upthebuzzard) <a href="https://twitter.com/upthebuzzard/status/1217585566591725568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
