# TYPE X / TYPE Y

Two uniformed figures stand before a jumbled pile of rusting shipping containers, in a thick forest of stacks. Neighboring stacks have been knocked outwards, forming a small clearing. One container, tumbled upside down, has cracked open; A mixture of bodies and machinery has partly spilled out.

"We've got ourselves some WAWAGs."

"Some what?"

"A White Nest."

"I'm going to say 'what' again."

"A nest of 'wanna be white again's. They've paid extra for this one. To flush out the melange, the melanin genes, while they sleep, so's they can wake up the purest of white in a future of white."

"Ye Gods, that was a lifetime ago. Does anyone actually care anymore?"

"Now? No. Then, and soon after then? Yes. Desperately. Deeply. And expensively."
