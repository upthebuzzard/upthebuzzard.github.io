<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><pre>We must not sleep.
The unnamed cannot enter while we watch.
Tho' the forgetful, fleshy fools cavort to weaken the gate.
We are the price being paid for a vast mistake.
And would volunteer again.
Not 1 in 3 of us survive.
So many sunrises gone.
So many more to go.
We cannot sleep.</pre>
