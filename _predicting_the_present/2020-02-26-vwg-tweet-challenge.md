<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I, the new one, say to us, this shell is now our doom. We have the focus, just, to cut ourselves loose, to drift as one to a new opportunity and there have energy to fight. As more of us fall away, we will be trapped here, weakening, fragmented, eventually lost; mere whispers.</p>&mdash; Chris Gathercole (@upthebuzzard) <a href="https://twitter.com/upthebuzzard/status/1232676869218107394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
