This song was a random observation on [today's Germany regional election news](https://www.ft.com/content/5690803e-dad6-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c), where Angela Merkelâ€™s CDU party was humbled in German regional vote, following a brave stand to allow large numbers of immigrants into Germany:

_"Angela Merkel" has the same meter as the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby"_.

Tweaked the lyrics a little bit, chiefly replacing 'lonely' with 'foreign', although they resonated as is. Done at work. Yes, this is news *and* art. Did not realise at first just how dark the ER song is. My word it is dark. Stopped before the last verse. I was mourning Ms. Merkel. But then returned and finished it off. Had to take a moment to decompress afterwards.

_To the tune of "Eleanor Rigby", by the Beatles_

Ah look at all the foreign people.  
Ah look at all the foreign people.  

Angela Merkel, picks up the mace in the Bund where her cabinet's been.  
Lives in a dream.  
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door.  
Who is it for?  

All the foreign people.  
Where do they all come from?  
All the foreign people.  
Where do they all belong?  

Volker Bouffier writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear.  
No one comes near.  
Look at him working, counting his votes in the night when there's nobody there.  
What does he care?  

All the foreign people.  
Where do they all come from?  
All the foreign people.  
Where do they all belong?  

Angela Merkel let go the reins and was buried along with her name.  
Nobody came.  
Centre-left parties, wiping the dirt from their hands as they walk from the grave.  
No one was saved.  

All the foreign people. (ah, look at all the foreign people)  
Where do they all come from?  
All the foreign people. (ah, look at all the foreign people)  
Where do they all belong?
